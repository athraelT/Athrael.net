                "Overview": "As expected, Federation Powers see the bulk of the Opposition in the game, but the numbers are simply amazing. Winters has seen more Opposition than all non-Federation Powers put together. Hudson isn't far behind. Imperial Powers, with the exception of Torval, essentially see no Opposition. The only Independent Power to see any real Opposition is Sirius Gov.\
            Undermining is more evenly spread, but some trends hold true. Federation still receives much more Undermining than non-Federal Powers. Hudson sees more undermining than all non-Federation Powers put together. Proportionally, Archon Delaine receives the most Undermining of any Power. There is very little Undermining done in Imperial systems, with the exception of Patreus space. Aisling in particular is subject to essentially no Undermining.<br /><br />\n\
            Fortification values seem mostly related to the number of systems a Power holds, more than anything. Most people seem to have figured out that fortifying systems beyond 100% is useless. There are two exceptions to this rule. One, every single Power seems to have one system that's massively over-fortified, likely just a by-product of merit farming. Two, Hudson supporters waste massive amounts of work over-fortifying their systems, whether through lack of game knowledge, not caring or over-reaction to the massive amounts of Undermining (likely some combination of the three).<br /><br />\n\
            Expansion seems to be quite evenly distributed. There's a trend to over-focus on Expansion across most Powers - as I'm writing this, Arissa has one system at over 6500% expansion to 16% opposition. Hudson, Arissa, Winters, Aisling and Mahon all see very similar values here.<br /><br />\n\
            Aisling dominates Preparation so hard it's not even funny. I've checked her top systems and she faces absolutely 0 competition there as well. I'm not sure what to read out of those values, other than Arissa and Aisling seem to have either lots of supporters or supporters with very, very deep pockets.<br /><br />\n\
            Federation Powers are the only ones even remotely at risk of their Expansions failing. Winters is especially vulnerable. It's extremely unlikely any other Power will have any of their Expansions not succeed any time soon, unless some concentrated effort is made. I'm not counting Pranav Antal since, again, bugged system.",

                "Body": "Major Faction imbalance is pretty crazy right now. Imperial Powers likely have at least twice the combined number of supporters of Federal Powers. Mahon, the lone Alliance Power, is even further behind. Out of the Independents, Archon is doing surprisingly well, especially given their preoccupation with other activities at the moment, and Sirius should do well, having been given a very easy starting position. Pranav Antal is, as expected, much smaller than any other faction. In fact, there's probably player groups in the Empire larger than the entirety of Utopia.<br /><br />\n\
                        Power ranks will change, and change a lot. Arissa and Aisling will almost certainly end up #1 and #2, likely in that order. Hudson might cling on to #3 in the short to medium term, but will fall lower than that long-term. Winters will almost certainly end up in the bottom 5, and very likely in the bottom 3. Li Yong-Rui will certainly jump up at least a rank long-term, given his easy, unopposed access to high-CC systems.<br /><br />\n\
                        Imperial Powers without a doubt benefit immeasurably by having the Empire split into 4 Powers, as long as Undermining Powers of the same major faction is extremely unattractive. In general, most Powers seem to be in very little risk from rivals at this point.",

                "Overview": "When it comes to Undermining, Federation Powers still see more of it than other Powers by an absolutely huge amount. With this level of enemy activity in their space, the numbers for Federal Powers are likely lower than they should be, since they need to deal with levels of PvP activity in their territory not seen elsewhere. The big difference is that this week Imperial Powers have actually seen some Opposition, while Opposition values for Federal Powers have decreased substantially. Imperial Powers still see extremely low amounts of Undermining, given their size.<br /><br />\n\
                                    In terms of sheer player support there's Aisling and Lavigny, and then there's everyone else. In fact, those two Powers have almost as much player activity between them as all non-Imperial Powers put together. Were it not for those two, you could say that player support is roughly equally spread out amongst Powers.",
                "Hudson": "again has seen more Undermining than all non-Federaton Powers put together. At the same time the old man had an easier time this week, as his Opposition values are half that of the previous Cycle. Position #3 is where I expected him to end up (likely slipping further in the near future) and #3 is where he should be if we go just by looking at overall activity numbers for each Power. As ever, Hudson followers lovely Fortification possibly at least partly because the Power doesn't have other easy ways of farming merits, but he has lost his crown to Arissa this week.",
                "Winters": "has got a bit of a breather last time. Yes, she still received almost as much Undermining as all non-Federation Powers put together, but her Opposition values are less than a third of what they were last Cycle, allowing her to succeed all of her Expansions. Winters, despite being a mid-sized Power, has actually done a good deal of Expansion this week, pulling ahead of Hudson in that respect. Other than that, there's nothing remarkable about her data.",
                "Arissa": "continues to be an absolute powerhouse. Despite being heavily involved in Opposition and Undermining actions in Federal space, this Power sees the most activity of any Power in the game, even overtaking Aisling this week. Arissa was #2 in Preparation and #3 Expansion, and she stole the crown from Hudson in one more respect - she is now the Over-Fortification Queen. This is the Power that won't even notice the 5x increase in Fortification triggers. Arissa has seen some increase in Opposition this week, but it's not terribly significant, and it was almost entirely confined to one, single system.",
                "Aisling": "just keeps on being Aisling Duval. Insanely high activity levels, on level with Lavigny are combined with almost 0 Opposition or Undermining. Despite the fact that Aisling space seems to be almost completely Elite: Peaceful, she's actually #2 in Expansion and #3 in Fortification as well as, of course, #1 in Preparation. This is the Power I'm unsure about - are the values from her higher than expected, since her followers face no real PvP danger within her space? Or are they actually lower, and will raise a lot if she's faced with challenges similar to Torval or some other Powers? It will be interesting to watch.",
                "Torval": "climbs up and up, more or less as expected. While she still saw very little Undermining, Granny Torval is actually this week's most Opposed Power, with several of her Expansions hotly contested. She is a mid-tier Power according to activity numbers, and it will be interesting to see if she maintains a spot in top #3 if she continues to see hostility. Torval is actually the #1 Power this week for Expansion values.",
                "Patreus": "The red-headed stepchild of the Empire. He's the only one not benefiting hugely from the Imperial Powers' safe strategic position. He has seem more hostility than his Imperial brethren in the past, but this Cycle has been something special. Relatively to its PP activity, this is the Power with perhaps the most Opposition this Cycle - I believe they lost 2 out of their 5 Expansions as a result, with one being barely won. Just so I say something positive... going through the data, Patreus struck me as the Power least likely to over-fortify by a lot, so while he may have fewer supporters, at least they use their time well.",
                "Mahon": "has seen good levels of activity this week, and some serious Opposition - with one of their Expansions being won by a very thin margin. Overall their Undermining values dropped in half, while their Opposition increased two times. They have actually reached #3 in Preparation values this Cycle, quite a feat considering they're a mid-sized Power.",
                "Sirius": ", while one of the smaller Powers in terms of activity, continues to expand steadily and without any great degree of opposition. If I'm correct, at no point did this Cycle were any of their Expansions under threat, and very few of their systems have been undermined. There has been an overall, significant increase in activity in this Power this Cycle, although whether that's the result of new recruits, or simply more merit farming, is impossible to say.",
                "Archon": "is one of those Powers I'm certain are bigger than their activity numbers relative to other Powers would suggest. Activity for the Kumo Crew has held more or less steady between Cycle #2 and Cycle #3, but they have been heavily involved in opposing Patreus' Expansion efforts this week, suggesting this Power has serious reserves to call onto if needed.",
                "Antal": ", aka The Power Frontier Forgot. Nestled in between two Independent Powers, Utopia continues to see relatively modest amounst of Opposition and Undermining. Analysing the data is tricky since last week the Power's only Expansion was bugged, this week one of the three was bugged. What's clear is that Antal is the smallest Power by a very significant margin, and will not be leaving the #10 spot any time soon.",
                "Intro": "This is where I make predictions and theories based on the flawed data I collected, my own observations, logic, science, my fear of snails and that dream I once had where Antal became the God-Emperor of Makind. You can probably skip reading this section.",
                "Body": "The Empire has so much more support than other major factions that it's not even funny. Okay, it's a little funny, but in the 'let's laugh AT FD rather than WITH them' way. I said before that we can't directly translate the activity numbers into player numbers, but general assumptions can be made. These numbers are mostly skewed, of course, by Arissa and Aisling. I believe that unless changes are made, we'll see more players gravitate towards the Empire still. In pure, mechanical terms, disregarding the lore, Arissa and Torval are the two best Powers in the game. Arissa caters to Bounty Hunting, the profession of choice for most players. Torval is the hands-down best Power for a trader.<br /><br />\n\
                                The top three spots will belong to Arissa, Aisling and Torval. That much has been clear from cycle #1, and the only question is how long it will take, and what order we can expect. Personally I'm expecting Arissa, Aisling, Torval, in that order. This is in the short to medium term, it's hard to make long-term assumptions without knowing the exact impact of overhead mechanics.<br /><br />\n\
                                Merit farming is the main motivator for a substantial number - I want to say a majority - of players in every single Power. In every Power efforts are wasted, sometimes in utterly daft ways. It's not uncommon, for example, to see one system Undermined to 1000%, while the nearby systems are not Undermined at all, or very little.<br /><br />\n\
                                Many players still don't understand Fortification. Every single Power over-fortifies. Moreover, there is a relationship between the amount of Undermining a Power suffers and how much Fortification it does, suggesting at least some players are not aware that Fortification over 100% does nothing. It would be nice if that could be made clearer in the UI.<br /><br />\n\
                                Frontier is kind of dropping the ball on Powerplay. Three weeks in we are yet to see significant balancing changes to Powerplay actions (other than today's Fortification change) and Powers with worthless perks and bonuses continue to 'enjoy' those. Additionally, it now appears that Overhead will be a major concern for all Powers - yet it's not explained to us how it works, nor is it clear how we can manage it.",

                "Overview": "The trigger increase last Cycle appears to have made some impact on overall activity, but it's not as major as one might have expected. Pranav Antal has seen the biggest increase in activity, while most Powers have seen an uptick of around 20%. Sirius is the only Power which has actually seen less activity this Cycle.<br /><br />We see a further gap between Powerplay activity in the Empire and elsewhere. At this point the combined activity for the Imperial Powers is significantly higher than the combined activity of all non-Imperial ones. In fact, Arissa and Aisling combined see more Powerplay activity than that of all non-Imperial Powers put together, and are chiefly responsible for this skewed trend. I felt the need to highlight that since they were moving towards that line for the past two Cycles, and have finally crossed it.<br /><br />Opposition and Undermining values are also skewed, albeit not as badly as in Cycle #2. Federation Powers see the bulk of hostile activity, with Torval and Archon the only other Powers to see anything approaching significant enemy action. Just like in the previous cycles, Archon remains the most Undermined faction in relation to its overall level of support. While Torval has seen only very modest amounts of Undermining, that Power has actually seen the most Opposition in Cycle #4.<br /><br />As expected, Fortification values have universally increased across Powers, though again this increase isn't as great as one might expect, given the fivefold increase in triggers. Arissa remains the galaxy's Over-Fortification Queen, however, Aisling claims the brand new title of Over-Expansion Queen. Her Expansion values are higher than that of all other Imperial Powers put together, despite the fact that she has seen close to zero Opposition. Hudson remains the Power with the highest Fortification values relative to overall Powerplay activity.<br /><br />As in previous Cycles, Arissa and Aisling do the bulk of Preparation in Powerplay. In fact, those two, combined, have done significantly more Preparation than all other Powers in the game, combined. I think it's safe to say you don't want to get into a Preparation race against either one of the two.",

I also try to make some guesses about overall player counts for each Power, an endeavour that is foolhardy given the many variables I can't properly account for. You can probably safely skip this section and do something productive with your time.",
                "Body": "What's to say about the Empire other than that the situation continues to be a little ridiculous. With bulk of player support and not much Opposition or Undermining in their space, Imperial Powers continue to have an easy time, with Overhead their only significant threat. I see the situation only getting more skewed as time goes on, given the incentives to join Imperial Powers.<br /><br />\n\
                                Patreus has in previous Cycles been the only Imperial Power under signficant threat, and his supporters did a good job of shoring up their borders in face of significant hostile action. However, it seems that the trigger increase might have put an end to that. Suddenly Patreus sees very little Undermining and Opposition, after Cycle #3 where he almost lost 3 Expansions and had several Fortifications cancelled. Without a doubt, this is the Power that has benefited the most from the trigger increase - with Kumo Crew now needing to spend more time in their own space, the Space Loan Shark is safe for now.<br /><br />\n\
                                While higher than in Cycle #3, the massive Undermining and Opposition that the Federation Powers have seen in Cycle #4 is actually lower than it has been in Cycle #2. That suggests to me that aggressive Imperial Expansions near Federal borders have had little, if any, effect in that regard - or that effect has been offset by other factors, such as Torval's defence of her Expansions.<br /><br />\n\
                                Not much has changed in that whatever strategies we might make on reddit or the forum, merit-farming still seems to be the primary motivator for many, likely most, players. This is true in every single Power, every one of them has done things this cycle that can only be described as monumentally stupid - such as pushing an unopposed Expansion to 500% while another one is at risk of failing, Preparing systems in the same area, over-fortifying one system while leaving others undefended... the list goes on. It's possible that at least some of this could be mitigated by changes in game mechanics or better UI indications of the impact of your Powerplay actions.<br /><br />\n\
                                It's hard to gauge which Power is the biggest in the game - Aisling or Arissa. Arissa's player count is probably higher than her Powerplay activity would suggest, since she has to complete the tedious and unrewarding combat actions for Expansion. At the same time, Aisling has edged ahead while apparently playing in a parallel Elite universe where everything is puppies, rainbows and friendship, and Opposition and Undermining haven't been invented. It's entirely possible that if Aisling ever sees significant hostile actions, she will mobile reserves of player support that are at this time largely dormant.<br /><br />\n\
                                I feel Winters deserves a special mention this Cycle. She is a mid-sized Power by activity while receiving huge amounts of hostile activity, yet her supporters have handled Fortification with the increased triggers beautifully. Very little over-fortification and no vulnerable systems to speak of. This is a Power that's getting a lot done with limited resources.<br /><br />\n\
                                It now has been a month since Powerplay release, and blatant balance and mechanics issues have not only not been fixed, Frontier has yet to comment on them. I don't want to harp on about this, as we might get some information in this week's dev update, but I find myself increasingly frustrated. Revamping Powerplay perks and bonuses so that no Power is stuck with clearly useless crap should be the priority right now.<br /><br />\n\
                                The increase in triggers is a good idea pushed out too early. With the population skewed as it is, it barely affected the biggest Powers and those who see little enemy action, while significantly stunting the growth of Independent Powers with less player support and putting the already disadvantaged Federation in an even tougher position.",

Hudson also appears to be successful on the Fortification front, with much lower Undermining, and no Undermining not being cancelled by Fortification, unlike last Cycle. Interestingly, this Power has Expanded towards safer places this past cycle - uncontested clusters and within existing borders, perhaps helping to reduce the amount of hostile activity they saw.",
                "Winters": "continues to be in a difficult situation, with support activity similar to Torval or Mahon, but receiving several times more hostile activity. On the Fortification front, the supporters of this Power managed to secure their systems against Undermining thanks to well spread out efforts. Results were rather mixed when it came to Expansions. Facing high Opposition, Winters lost Sengen Sama and San Qin Gu, both of them bordering Imperial Powers. However Lambla and Caorneck, in safer locations, have been successfully claimed by Winters, continuing this Power's steady growth.",
                "Arissa": "reminds us that she's one of the big two Powers in the game by holding on to the #2 spot in overall activity despite having no Preparation to do. With that gone, Lavigny commanders seem to have focused on Fortification, despite the low levels of Undermining. Fun fact- Arissa did more Fortification in Guathiti than Winters' combined Powerplay activity. Despite the fact that the systems Nunus and Varka have fallen into turmoil, Arissa secured several new Expansions this Cycle.",

This Power continues to easily Fortify with little Undermining and the Expand at a rapid pace, though for the first time (correct me if I'm wrong), Aisling's Expansion was actually stopped, when the attempt at Sounti failed. Interestingly, despite the appeal of Aisling's unique module, she hasn't seen the drop in activity many expected once modules have been unlocked.",

In fact, her attempts to take HIP 95256, Chowei and Ye'Kuape - all bordering Federation space - have failed. Still, with around 4 Expansions secured each cycle this Power is doing rather well for itself.",
                "Patreus": "definitely continues to benefit from the increase to Expansion and Fortification triggers, which instantly dropped the level of hostile activity in his space a couple cycles ago. With fairly high Undermining and Opposition given this Power's size, they seem to have focused on Fortifying and Expanding select systems, making use of limited resources to secure steady growth. As a result, several of their Expansions failed this week, but they have secured four others.",
                "Mahon": "continues to do well for himself. Great strategic position, good amount of player support, smart expansion choices and little hostile activity mean the Alliance Power was able to easily secure its Expansion and Fortify most of their systems with little Undermining. Bonitou was an interesting exception, seeing huge amounts of Undermining, likely due to its strategic position between Li-Yong Rui, Mahon, the Federation and the Empire.",
                "Sirius": "continues to enjoy mostly smooth sailing, compared to other Powers. They have an amazing strategic position, with little-contested access to high-value systems, especially now that they have twice repelled Patreus' Expansion into Apalok. As before, Sirius Gov sees little enemy action in their space, with the exception of 39 Tauri and Akkadia, bordering Federation space.",
                "Archon": "is in a bit of a tough spot. With fairly low amounts of player support but rather high opposition, Archon's systems continue to see a lot of Undermining, although that is successfully countered by Fortification. More worryingly, not a single of the Kumo Crew Expansions succeeded this cycle. This is partly because of that low activity, partly because of enemy action and at least in part because one of the pirate lord's Expansion systems appears to be bugged. This has always been a Power I believe has more support than the activity numbers would suggest, given two facts - its Combat Expansion ethos, and Archon's supporters' propensity to spend their time in enemy space and not their own. Those Commanders out causing trouble elsewhere might have to come back home soon if they want to see Archon succeed.",
                "Antal": "is doing reasonably well for such a small Power, though I may be biased here. Out of the five prepared systems, two were successfully Expanded into, the the other seeing very little player activity. Utopia seems to secure its expansions with relative ease, it does its fortification, and it continues to see low levels of hostile activity, with the exception of Ewah, a Federation system where Antal Expansion was successfully Opposed. For a couple of Cycles now this Power has been focusing on Expansions with high Opposition triggers, meaning it's mostly Expanding close to its HQ and shoring up its existing Control. While this means they will miss out on some systems other Powers are rushing for, it's a fairly safe and secure way to expand Utopia.",

Good news, though - things aren't getting worse on that front, as they have been the last two Cycles.

On a practical level, the smart thing for Aisling supporters to do would be to get their shields, then join either Torval or Arissa, the Powers with the best perks and bonuses in the game. Yet we see no drop in the activity for Aisling.<br /><br />Many assumed that Arissa's supporters, lacking things to do without Preparation, would increase their Undermining and Opposition efforts against Federation Powers, but that doesn't seem to have happened. While Winters' opposition is pretty stable, Hudson actually has seen a significant drop in hostile activity in his space. That's probably partly a product of the overall drop in activity, but personally I noticed the Federation Powers earn a breather every time they seriously commit to Opposing an Imperial Expansion - they have previously greatly benefited, in a roundabout way, from the hotly contested Imperial Expansion into Panscienses (I tried). Seems like offence is the best defence.<br /><br />Equally surprisingly, nobody seems to have taken advantage of Arissa's weakness and hit her where it hurts - CC, by Undermining her systems.

Now that his supporters no longer allow Undermining to seriously hurt this Power, Hudson is in a good shape and should keep a spot in the top 3 for the foreseeable future. The one danger this Power faces are its low levels of Expansion activity. Should it see serious Opposition in the coming weeks, it may see multiple Expansions failing, and in the wake of Overhead changes that might not necessarily be a good thing any more. Or it might be, I'm not actually sure.",

Still, Winters is doing well, growing at a steady pace and cancelling out all Undermining. This is a Power that has figured out what to do with its limited resources, and at this point its rank will mostly, IMO, be determined by what happens to the other Powers. If Mahon and Sirius start seeing some serious enemy activity, she will keep a spot in the top 3 or 4 Powers. Otherwise, she'll probably hover around the 4 - 6 range. Interestingly, Winters has seen no significant drop in activity in the wake of the disbanding of the Merchant Marines. Either that loss was offset elsewhere, or made up by the forming The Minutemen, a new Winters player group that seems to be recruiting quite actively.",
                "Arissa": "still holds her #2 spot despite her Turmoil troubles and the lack of Expansions this week. Fortification appears to have filled the gap once more, with Guathiti seeing an amazing 236,013 powerplay cargo delivered. This is not quite as high as last Cycle, but it's still more than the total Powerplay activity for Archon or Patreus. Unless Overhead strikes again, it seems fair to assume that Arissa will return to her #1 spot this Cycle or the next. Same as with Aisling, Arissa hasn't suffered a significant activity drop, suggesting that people leaving the Power after getting their unique module aren't a major issue, and that short-lived turmoil did not affect her strongly.",
                "Aisling": "broke the 1 million Powerplay actions barrier this Cycle. Congratulations! This Power continues to benefit from very low levels of hostile action in her space, and continuously expands as quickly as possible - with a few exceptions. The Expansion into Ax Yac Baru has been stopped, just like last Cycle, presumably mostly by Winters' pilots. Despite that, Aisling continues to rapidly grow stronger, and has recently gained another player group, the 13th Legion. The surprising drop in rankings this week is certainly only temporary, and she will end up in the top 2 before long.",
                "Torval": "is the single Power with the biggest activity drop this Cycle. With EIC withdrawing their support for her, it was expected that Zemina would drop, however the decrease is greater than I personally expected, suggesting that East India Company accounted for a significant chunk of this Power's support. Two things do work in Torval's favour. 'Imperial Lone Wolf Wing', a new player group, has stepped in to attempt to plug the gap left by EIC, and Torval has seen a significant drop in hostile activity at the same time their own activity has dropped. Unless something changes, I would expect Torval to remain around #6, with the possibility of a further drop if serious enemy activity in her space resumes.",
                "Patreus": "does not appear to have particularly benefited from the unveiling of unique modules, despite the common consensus being that his Plasma Accelerator is one of the few useful Powerplay weapons. At the same time, while Patreus sees a good deal of Undermining, there's not much Opposition to his Expansions. As such, he'll probably remain one of the lower-ranked Powers, but due to some smart Fortification and the ongoing Imperial efforts in Kumo Crew space, he is no longer in grave danger in the same way he was before the trigger increase a couple of weeks ago.",
                "Mahon": "has grown rapidly this Cycle and is Preparing another heavy round of Expansions next Cycle. With its good strategic position and some fine organisation, this Power is making the most of this early period where they still see no serious Undermining or Opposition. As they push closer to the space of several other Powers (Aisling, Lavigny, Hudson, Winters, Sirius and probably a couple of others) they'll certainly see more hostile action, but for the short to medium term, they'll probably continue to expand quickly.",
                "Sirius": "is really in a quite similar position to Mahon. Good strategic position, little Opposition or Undermining, opportunities to expand towards several other Powers, rapid growth. However, Sirius might find itself stretched thin in the future. A change in mechanics or politics could rapidly expose Sirius to serious enemy action, and unlike Mahon they haven't yet shown they can deal with that. Their attempted expansion into Chounjemait this past Cycle sparked a conflict with Mahon, although it's hard to tell if that's a harbinger of future war - one can't imagine that Sirius' followers fought with particular zeal for a 0 CC system. In any case, Li Yong-Rui had another week of steady expansion and a modest increase in overall activity. For now at least this Power continues to do very well for itself.",
                "Archon": "continues to see quite massive amounts of enemy activity compared to Archon's own support. The combined Imperial offensive into the Pegasi sector has continued this week, with several systems seeing heavy Opposition and especially Undermining. It's some surprise, then, that Archon has not particularly suffered this week. He was able to secure three Expansions, and none of his systems were successfully Undermined. Partially that's thanks to focused efforts of Archon's supporters, who fortified those systems most at risk, and mostly Expanded systems with good triggers, a crucial tactic for Powers with a combat Expansion ethos. However, the slow progress of the Imperial offensive is in no small part due to the Imperials themselves. While the tactic of focusing on Undermining rather than Opposing is arguably sound, Undermining was focused on just a handful of the Kumo Crew systems, mostly those bordering Imperial space. Many of Archon's systems were completely untouched even though they were not Fortified, while already Fortified systems were heavily Over-Undermined by the Imperial Attackers. This is not a mistake unique to this particular offensive, but it's one that has helped Archon immensely.",
                "Antal": "just chills out in Utopia. I mean, why wouldn't he, it's Utopia, it's great by definition. After securing 2 systems the previous cycle, Utopians now Expanded into just one, continuing the post-trigger-increase trend of slow and steady growth for this Power. With very low levels of support and enemy activity alike, Antal remains fairly safe as long as his supporters continue to focus on 'safe' expansions with good triggers and to do smart Fortifications, as they have done in the last few weeks. At the same time, this is the Power most at risk if Undermining mechanics change so that Independents can fight each other effectively.",
                "Intro": "This is the section I just use for ranting about whatever I feel like. It's the thing that keeps me same after few hours of compiling this stuff. Also I get to tell you my opinions and you can't stop me, so that's nice. You can safely skip this section and do something useful with your time instead.",
                "Body": "The Powerplay balance between the Empire and other factions continues be very skewed, but less so than in the previous cycles. This is likely at least partially because of the drop in support for Patreus and Torval, as well as the turmoil issues for Lavigny which meant she had no Expansions this Cycle. This is a pretty minor change, though, and unless we see some changes to the mechanics, Aisling and Arissa will most likely remain the two biggest Powers in the game by some considerable margin.<br /><br />We've seen another drop in Undermining and Opposition in Empire space, to the point that now Independents see more of both than the Imperials. That's another symptom of the current Undermining and Opposition mechanics and the way they dis-incentive fighting Powers in the same major faction as yours. While rebalancing those mechanics might seem an obvious change, I've been thinking about it, and FD are in a tricky situation. Balance things a bit too much, and several Powers will probably disappear quite quickly - Patreus and Antal being most at risk. This is not necessarily an entire bad thing, but an argument could be made that any such change should only come after perks and bonuses across Powers are balanced first, with the hope that population is a bit more spread out across all Powers.<br /><br />Not one system in the entire inhabited galaxy was succesfully Undermined this Cycle. To re-iterate, when I say 'successfully Undermine', I mean that Undermining trigger would be reached, but not the Fortification one. Especially seeing the absolutely massive amount of Undermining Hudson and Winters are experiencing this is quite a shock. Personally, I don't think this is a fault of mechanics (at least not entirely), but rather player behaviour. Just with Fortification, Undermining is simply farmed. Hudson, for example, had many systems undermined several hundred percent, while others were completely untouched, despite the fact that they weren't Fortified, and Undermining them would hurt that Power severely. Hudson, Aisling, Torval, Arissa, Winters - those big Powers are very vulnerable to Undermining as a method of forcing Turmoil, yet what Undermining is being is, is very, very inefficient. I was very surprised to see the same pattern during the Imperial offensive against Archon Delaine, as I presumed that would be a more organised affair. Unless this changes, we'll have a slightly stagnant situation in Powerplay.<br /><br />The expected shift of support as the more mercenary-minded players got their rewards and left hasn't materialised yet. That's not to say that it will not come soon, but I know some amongst us expected, for example, Aisling to drop like a stone once people got their shields. Well, it ain't so, and I have to profess I'm slightly surprised.<br /><br />Adding a point I forgot about. IMO, Combat and Social Expansion ethos is the biggest issue with Powerplay right now. You can see the Expansion values for Combat and Social Powers drop every week, and it will be a huge issue as time goes. Either rebalancing is needed, or every ethos should work the same as Finance for the purposes of Expansion, at least until a better solution is found.",

                "Overview": "Just like last Cycle, the overall level of Powerplay activity is stable, although the distribution of that activity does change. We've seen an increased level of support for the biggest Powers, while the smallest ones (Torval, Patreus, Archon, Antal) have seen further drops. The story is similar when it comes to opposition levels. While Undermining and Opposition in Federal space dropped a fair amount, Independents and Mahon have seen an increase in hostile activity at the same time.",
                "Hudson": "has had something of a mixed week. Two of his three Expansions have succeeded, which is a decent result considering the levels of Opposition he's seeing. However, unlike in the previous weeks, Undermining succeeded in one of Hudson's systems - just one, but that still translates to a fairly significant loss of CC to a Power as large as this. Hudson has in the past done very well in defending against staggering amounts of Undermining, so this mistake must sting, especially given how heavily over-fortified a lot of his systems were. As long as his supporters can avoid more such slip-ups, he should climb back up in the next cycle or two, though.",
                "Winters": "lost her cherished #1 Undermined spot to Hudson, although she is now #1 most Opposed Power. This Opposition resulted in the loss of the Expansion at Potamoi, but Winters was still able to secure three others. Just like before her systems have not yielded to massive Undermining, and not one has been successfully undermined. As impressive as that may be, however, Winters probably won't climb back up into #3 for now, unless Mahon suffers particularly badly from Turmoil. With activity levels a bit behind Mahon, who at the same time sees much less Opposition and Undermining, the only way Winters might get back into the top 3 is by the misfortune of her neighbours.",
                "Arissa": "enjoyed a brief respite from Turmoil, and you can see her activity climb somewhat as a result. Two things are striking about this Power. First, her overall level of activity suggests that Arissa has even more support than Aisling - her figures are slightly low, but only slightly, despite the fact she's saddled with the unfavourable Combat Expansion ethos. Second, Opposition to Arissa's Expansions is absolutely tiny, in fact non-existent for all intents and purposes. Partially this must be because of her two expansions' safe positioning, deep in Imperial space, but it may also reflect the realisation on the part of Arissa's enemies that opposing her Expansions is largely futile. Instead, we've seen a steady increase in Undermining for this Power - still not particularly threatening, given her overall size, but certainly contributing to her current Turmoil.",
                "Aisling": "continues to push over 1 million Powerplay actions this Cycle, just like last week. It's a staggering number, reflecting a combination of the favourable Finance ethos with Aisling's huge support base. The Princess appears to have finally secured a spot in the top 3, a spot she was heading for since cycle #1, and failing any new developments she should continue to do extremely well for herself, with widespread fortification, many successful Expansions and middling hostile activity in her space. Just like in the previous two Cycles, Aisling failed just one expansion - HIP 95256, due to a late push by the enemy (likely Mahon, given the system's position).",
                "Torval": "sees another drop in activity, albeit much smaller than the shocking drop last Cycle, after the withdrawal of East India Company. At this point it seems extremely unlikely that Torval will climb above #7 unless something disastrous happens to the Power above her. She may very well drop lower than that if she once again starts seeing the levels of enemy activity she was experiencing 2 - 3 weeks ago. Given her size and low activity, she is in particular danger of being pushed into Turmoil even by just a few dedicated Wings - she already had one system Undermined this Cycle. It's not all doom and gloom, though. Some smart, focused efforts on the part of Torval's supporters have allowed her to secure several more Expansions this week, although Mandhrithar fell last minute to an Opposition push. Like many small Powers, Torval is starting to make better use of limited resources, and the activity of Protectores Zemina Nostri is helping to fill the gap left by EIC.",
                "Patreus": "still has not seen an up-tick of activity as result of people flocking to him to get his unique module, which is what many people expected. In fact, he has seen another drop in activity - the Power that once was #5, now has overall support similar to that of Antal. His Expansion values are especially low, leaving him at extreme danger of Opposition stopping his expansion whatsoever, which would have disastrous consequences, as Patreus is in the bottom 3 Powers. To the credit of his supporters they have used their Expansion efforts well - abandoning all but one attempts, and focusing their actions on one system with a very high Opposition trigger. As long as they continue to do so, and keep cancelling out Undermining with well-focused Fortification, Patreus might just do fine.",
                "Mahon": "has had his rapid, sustained Expansion over the last few weeks both pay off and catch up to him at the same time. His #3 spot is well-earned - although he's behind Hudson in activity, he enjoys much less enemy activity that the Federation President. He had access to some wonderful high-income systems, an opportunity his supporters took full advantage of. On the flip side, Mahon's space now stretches over a lot of real estate, and as a result he borders pretty much every single Power in the game. As the Alliance major faction consists of only Mahon, all of those neighbours can effectively Undermine and Oppose Mahon, and we have seen the effects of that in Cycle #7. Undermining in Mahon's space increased by good 50%, leading to four of his systems being successfully Undermined, likely leading to his current Turmoil troubles.",
                "Sirius": "certainly had a productive week. Despite an upticking in Undermining just as bad as Mahon's, none of his systems were successfully Undermined, and none of his Expansions failed. Sirius faces a situation potentially as threatening as that of the Alliance Power, but the risk is partly mitigated by his strategic position, reducing the number of neighbours, and having one 'secure' flank, where he borders other Independents, who can't fight him effectively. Considering how well Sirius' supporters have been doing, and the troubles some other Powers are finding themselves in, Li Yong-Rui might be able to climb another spot or two in the near future.",
                "Archon": "is finally feeling the sting of Operation Davy Jones, the Imperial offensive against the Kumo Crew. While he managed to secure two more systems this week - a significant success, given his level of activity and Combat expansion ethos - out of the total 12 systems successfully Undermined this Cycle, 6 belonged to Archon. This is a very significant blow to the pirate lord's CC income, which means he can only Prepare 3 systems in Cycle #8. This is crucial, as having more systems to choose from makes securing one or two easier, and should Archon fail to gain any Expansions in the future, the Power might start falling apart. The next 2 - 3 Cycles will be crucial, and should the Imperials continue to refine their efforts, as they did in Cycle 7, Archon might find himself under a lot of pressure.",
                "Antal": "enjoys that rare Powerplay commodity - Peace. What little Opposition his Expansions saw in Cycle 7 have been in systems he wasn't pushing anyway, and Antal is the only Power that has not seen a single one of his Fortifications cancelled by Undermining. Just like in the case of Patreus, Utopians have chosen a single system with a high Opposition trigger and pushed that, focusing their efforts and fortifying for extra income, thus ensuring the Power is in no danger of collapse for now. Their acquisition of HIP 116213, overlapping with Archon space, added a small drop to the Kumo Crew's troubles, but other than that Antal's supporters continue to enjoy a neutral, somewhat pacifistic position in PP. This may change fairly rapidly, as even modest enemy activity could prove problematic for this Power, but Utopia already endures longer than many expected.",

                "Body": "In the past weeks I've ranted a bit about Powerplay balance between the Empire and the other factions. As time goes on, it's clear that's not a real issue any more. The balance problem is between the few big Powers and everyone else. For example, Aisling sees more activity than Antal, Archon, Sirius, Torval and Patreus put together. The same goes for Arissa. In effect, Powerplay is very 'top heavy', with the overwhelming majority of player activity focused in the top 3 Powers, and the bottom 3 - 4 seeing less and less support as time goes on.<br /><br />In Cycle 6 the entire galaxy has not seen a single successful Undermining. This was particularly striking in the case of Operation Davy Jones, where huge amounts of Undermining effort were effectively wasted, bringing few results. This has changed a good deal in Cycle 7, with Archon seeing 6 Undermined systems, Mahon 3 and both Hudson and Torval 1 each. Whether this is an effect of smarter Undermining (which still tends to be focused on a few systems, leaving most untouched) or dumber Fortification I can't quite tell, but something is finally happening, so yay. Hopefully we'll see more of that in the weeks to come.<br /><br />All Powers are very vulnerable to SMART Undermining. Whether you're with Antal or Arissa, it doesn't matter, your space is ripe of enemy strikes. Even the biggest Powers in the game leave at least a dozen systems unfortified, leaving them very open to Undermining strikes. This is a particular danger for bigger Powers, with more systems to secure, and thin CC margins as result of Overhead. I think this is a point worth repeating. As imbalanced as things might seem at first, if you're smart about the way you fight other Powers, none are immune to potentially ruinous Undermining.<br /><br />Arissa had a combined Opposition of less than 800. I thought that was funny enough to warrant its own point, but I'll expand upon it. It has been 7 weeks, and the two biggest Powers in the game still see very, very little Opposition and Undermining given their size. With no balancing or changes to Undermining mechanics on the horizon, this doesn't seem likely to change any time soon - though I suppose I'm not the only one expecting something to happen after the Imperial Wedding (which I'm sure will go 100% smoothly without anyone getting horribly murdered).<br /><br />Fun fact - the big Powers send Preparation materials to literally hundreds of systems. Hudson outdid everyone in that regard, doing some Preparation in over 600 systems. Sure, some of that preparation was 20, or 5 or 2 tonnes, but nevertheless, I thought that was interesting.",

This is mostly because of some pretty significant drop in Empire and Federation activity. The Alliance has picked up some of the slack, in both respects, but overall the numbers are lower. I don't want to speculate too much about the reasons, but turmoil issues certainly paid a big part - we've never had as many Powers in turmoil as we did this week.<br /><br />Opposition activity is in one way more evenly spread out. It used to be that pretty much only the Federation and Archon saw significant hostile activity, with other Powers having a relatively easy time, but now Mahon and Sirius are also starting to feel the hurt. In another way, things turned more uneven - the Imperial Powers, despite seeing significantly more activity than their non-Imperial rivals, saw another drop in opposition. At this point all four Imperials combined see less opposition than Archon or Mahon, or either of the Federation Powers.",
                "Hudson": "was in Turmoil as well, and saw a drop in activity likely at least partly connected to that. Although Hudson's supporters do a lot of Fortification - 3rd most in the game - this Power sees worryingly little Expansion. This is a problem common to all Powers with the Combat or Social expansion ethos, but it hurts Hudson the most, as he sees significant Opposition since launch of Powerplay. This will likely be the main beneficiary of this week's buff to combat expansion. On the plus side, the massive Undermining of Hudson's systems failed to succeed anywhere - partly due to being too focused on a few systems, partly because of more spread out Fortification on part of the President's supporters.",
                "Winters": "has long been the Power in perhaps the most difficult position in the game - a title stolen from her by Archon in recent weeks. With absolutely massive amounts of Undermining compared to her own activity, she has nevertheless secured 3 out of her four expansions and fortified against all undermining attempts. Winters' supporters continue to impress, but she might be one of the big losers of the recent mechanics changes. Simply put, it seems her fairly small support base is already very stretched, and might not be able to cope with the added strain of the more effective Undermining, to say nothing of the proposed increase to Fortification triggers.",
                "Arissa": "enjoyed Turmoil again, and as before, her supporters compensated by doing Fortification like crazy - the smart thing to do for a Power in their situation. Despite suffering a grand total of 45 Opposition she somehow managed to secure her one expansion. Despite the Undermining she sees being very modest, it seems better spread out than that against Aisling, leading to 6 of her Fortifications being cancelled. The active support behind this Power continues to support, as they're able to continue to field the core of the offensive against Archon and heavily oppose the Federation, while easily securing their own space.",
                "Aisling": "is always a bit of a difficult Power for me to talk about, in part because not a whole lot happens to her. She has lots of support, almost zero opposition, and a fairly safe strategic position. This Cycle not a single one of her systems was Undermined, none of her Fortifications were cancelled, none of her Expansions failed, and in fact she received a grand total of zero Opposition. The Peoples' Princess is at the top and unless this week's mechanics changes stir things up significantly, she'll be staying at the top for the foreseeable future. Certainly I don't see any scenario other than some carastrophic Overhead failure that pushes her out of the top 2.",
                "Torval": "has had her overall activity drop for the third week in a row. On one hand, that further confirms that Torval is extremely unlikely to again rise to the heights she once reached, and top 3 is pretty much unattainable for her. Her supporters do a fine job with limited resources, and she's in no danger of a further drop in the rankings right now, but the Senator continues to be the target of some rather focused Undermining. Even though the amount of Undermining in her space is hardly huge, her enemies once again succeeded in Undermining one of her systems, Tanghpon.",
                "Patreus": "too has seen a drop in activity, but smart efforts on the part of his pledged pilots and lack of hostile activity mean that he's in a secure position for now - or at least as secure as a Power in the bottom 3 can ever be. Patreus won a major Preparation race against Archon in Cuchua, and although that race distracted a lot of his pilots' attention that would have been better spent elsewhere, nobody took advantage of this Power's rather weak Fortification and Expansion. With two expansions secured and just one fortification negated, Patreus continues to run a great CC surplus, giving him a useful buffer against Undermining.",
                "Mahon": "keeps his #3 spot despite a pretty massive surge in enemy activity against him. With his only expansion, in Lugh, succeeding in face of some pretty stiff Opposition, and all Undermining attempts stopped by Fortification (with 9 Fortifications cancelled), his supporters have done well to guard their top 3 slot. Mahon is now firmly one of the biggest, most important Powers in PP, and will remain in top 5 without a doubt. Whether he can keep his #3 slot depends in large part on the impact of the Undermining changes, and his pilots' ability to deal with increasingly spread-out territory.",
                "Sirius": "grabbed 5 more systems this week, had no systems successfully Undermined, and had only 3 Fortifications cancelled. All in all, Sirius Gov continues to have a pretty easy ride in Powerplay. With very good territory, good expansion choices and a secure flank with Antal, this probably won't change for now. What will be interesting to see is how running out of space will affect this Power - with their borders continuously pushing closer to the Alliance, Federation and the Empire, they might yet be in for some serious fights. I can't see Sirius climbing more ranks at this point, and I wouldn't be surprised to see them drop a place next week, as Hudson climbs back up.",
                "Archon": "has 6 out of the 7 successfully Undermined systems from this Cycle, a further blow to his CC that spells serious trouble in light of the recent changes to Undermine, and the planned increase to Fortification triggers. The Kumo Crew has now resisted some pretty overwhelming odds (just look at that support-to-opposition ratio!) for around 5 weeks, and they have a fine job defending their space, but it feels like any further changes to mechanics that will make it more difficult to defend against Undermining will break this Power. Due to a mix of Opposition, bugs and poorly chosen Expansion targets, Archon secured no Expansions this Cycle. It's not all doom and gloom, though. Archon's failure to secure an Expansion wasn't particularly penalised, even though he he's in the bottom 3, likely because their prime Expansion target was bugged (again). While Archon's people only Prepared two systems, one of those two has very good expansion triggers, making them fairly secure on the opposition front this week, especially in the wake of the much-welcome buff to combat expansion.",

After weeks of only getting 1 or 2 expansions a Cycle and low activity overall, Pranav Antal suddenly grabbed a grand total of four Expansions. In fact, the Expansion value for this Power is higher than for Hudson - and if you recall a recent dev post, Antal is the Power with fewest supporters in the game, while Hudson has the most. This is attributed to some unknown player group (which some of came to call The Many) that suddenly threw their weight behind the Simguru. Their identity is unknown, and it's not at all clear if we'll see the same thing this week - it's entirely possible this week was a one-off fluke. On another mildly interesting note - this Cycle Pranav Antal saw a remarkable balance in activity between Preparation, Expansion and Fortification. I thought that was kinda cool.",

In many cases that increase has been threefold or more, and it's quite unevenly spread, but all Powers have seen more hostile activity. The Cycle also saw an increase to piracy rewards, allowing for easier opposing of Powers in the same major faction as your own. It's unclear what effect that had, but it was probably minor at best - the four least opposed Powers are now all Imperial, for example. The boost to opposition meant that a total 42 systems were successfully Undermined, compared to just 6 the previous week. <br /><br />Those Powers with a Combat or Social Expansion ethos who were able to expand this Cycle (Antal, Patreus and Archon) saw a spike in expansion activity of around 10 times the previous value. This suggests that while the rewards are higher the actual engagement in expansions in those Powers hasn't changed and neither have Commanders flocked to those Powers now that they offer an efficient way of gaining merits. Of course this was just the first week of the change and we are yet to see the effect of the two biggest combat Powers, Arissa and Hudson. <br /><br />Overall activity has remained mostly steady, with only the Federation seeing a modest drop, and the Independents experiencing a sharp increase in activity as a result of increased Expansion values from Antal and Patreus. With the recent changes there is more opposition than support activity going on in Powerplay.",
                "Hudson": "is a Power I made fun of before for their massive over-fortification of certain systems while leaving others vulnerable, but there's no denying they did very well this Cycle. Despite receiving pretty massive amounts of Undermining, only one of their systems was successfully Undermined, giving Hudson a lovely CC surplus and justifying his rise in the rankings despite the lack of expansions. Hudson is still likely to be in a difficult situation post-opposition buff, but this Cycle at least he has weathered the storm very well.",
                "Winters": "is just in a tough, tough spot. In a way it's surprising that her supporters managed to offset the damage, through smart fortification, enough so that only one of her systems is in Turmoil this week. At support-to-opposition ratio of 22%, fairly low support levels and absolutely staggering levels of opposition, the fact that Winters hasn't just imploded is either a testament to her supporter's efforts, or to some peculiar aspects of Powerplay mechanics. With 9 systems successfully Undermined and 2 out of her 3 Expansions failing, Winters didn't have a great Cycle. At this point, what happens to Winters is as much up to the mechanics of PP as to the determination of her supporters. If the plot of Imperial strife actually takes off at some point, she will probably recover, just as she has done before, and even climb the rankings. If the proposed increase to Fortification triggers is implemented, though, it will almost certainly mean - at best - a loss of a large chunk of territory for this Power.",
                "Arissa": "has managed to do enough fortification to offset the two successfully Undermined systems in her space, though it's still surprising that a Power with that level of activity and no Expansions to take care of didn't manage to stop Undermining. This is a testament to how even the biggest Powers simply don't have the activity to fortify all of their systems, leaving them vulnerable to late Undermining merit drops. Unless something changes, however, Arissa will be fine for now - even with 2 systems Undermined she sports a 390 CC surplus, giving her a nice buffer even if her Undermining doubled or tripled. In the medium to long term she's sure to fall into limited Turmoil again, but it shouldn't affect her ability to stay in the top 2 long-term.",
                "Aisling": "is the most supported and least opposed Power this Cycle. She's one of the few Powers with no successfully Undermined systems, her one Expansion saw only fairly modest Opposition, and just a handful of her systems had fortification negated. It's a little surprsing, then, that she has fallen into Turmoil, seeing how she's under less pressure than Arissa and has 2 fewer Control systems. It would appear that increased Undermining combined with some questionable expansion choices in the past are catching up to the Princess. That being said, her troubles are likely to be temporary, and I expect to see her back in top 2 soon.",
                "Torval": "has, for the fourth week in a row, seen a drop in activity. This, alongside the boost combat Powers have received, means that the Power that once seemed quite certain to keep a spot in the top #3 is now firmly in the last place when it comes to Powerplay activity. With 5 systems Undermined and her only Expansion failing, Torval's drop to #8 is understandable. Only some strong fortification efforts have stopped the Senator from dropping into Turmoil this week, and she's left with only 80 CC for her Preparation. While she gets nowhere near the Undermining and Opposition of Winters or Archon, Torval might in fact be more vulnerable than either of those.",
                "Patreus": "must be well beloved at Frontier - it seems like almost every change to mechanics benefits him. I'm joking, of course, but just like the trigger increase, the boost to Combat expansion has given Patreus an amazing boost. It's this Power's increase in activity that made up for the drop in support for other Imperial Powers this Cycle, leading to a rapid round of expansion like the Senator hasn't seen in the last few weeks. At the same time Denton's Fortification values have more than doubled. While one of his Expansions failed and two of his systems were successfully Undermined, it seems this Power has more life in it than some might have supposed. It remains to be seen if this surge continues, especially as rapid expansion leaves the Senator more vulnerable to possible increase in opposition.",
                "Mahon": "has certainly earned his #2 slot this week. Despite having 8 systems Undermined, Mahon's fortification was efficient enough to make up for that, giving him a respectable CC surplus now that he can do Preparation again. That being said, it's very, very unlikely that the Alliance politician will keep this high position. He now sees very high levels of opposition over a very spread out territory, and now that his supporters can do Preparation again his fortification value is likely to drop. Within two Cycles Aisling is likely to be back in #2, with Mahon in #3 or #4 - his position depending on if the opposition against him stays at this high level.",
                "Sirius": "saw a drop in activity, but even though two of his systems have been Undermined he's in no particular risk, giving his strong Fortification values and the resulting CC surplus. What is interesting is that Sirius has seen a support-to-opposition ratio drop from 238% to 54%, making him 3rd worst off in that regard. While Li Yong-Rui's supporters have dealt well with this sudden increase in hostilities, it will be interesting to see if a Power that previously hasn't seen much hardship will be able to deal with this sort of sustained pressure in the weeks to come. Sirius kept #4 this week, but he is almost certain to drop to #5 or lower next Cycle - though the fact that he climbed this high in the first place is quite extraordinary.",
                "Archon": "is in a strange position right now. With an awful support-to-opposition ratio of 19%, the highest opposition in the game, one of his two expansions failing and 14 (likely incorrect, there have been some last-minute pushes) of his systems Undermined, you'd think that Operation Davy Jones is a step away from victory and destroying the Kumo Crew. Things have in fact gone as the Imperial High Command envisioned them - they secured Cuchua and kept up the effort at Kakmbutan, one of Archon's expansion, as a diversion while fully undermining Archon's space. As a result the long conflict in Cuchua is over and not a single of Archon's system was successfully Fortified. In that way the Imperial attackers succeeded tactically - but strategically, Archon holds his own. His pilots were able to fortify enough systems to ensure a modest CC surplus, enough for 2 Preparation, and their Preparation from Cycle #9 yielded them at least one expansion with an amazing trigger that the Imperials might not be able to overcome. At this point it seems like Archon might be able to defend Pegasi Sector indefnintely, unless his supporters mess up Preparation or the Imperials make a really amazing effort to stop their Expansion. Or, and this is an option I think is quite likely, FD might increased the Fortification triggers.",
                "Antal": "for second week in a row things happened in Pranav Antal's Utopia, and that makes me all excited, given how quiet our space has been for a while. Two weeks ago, Antal's expansion values roughly tripled. Now, with the combat expansion boost, they have increased ten times. With some of the bigger Powers unable to expand this week, Antal actually the highest Expansion values of any Power, and where he used to be firmly in the last place when it came to overall activity, it was now #5. The Sothis Project, an attempt to expand into that distant colony, has failed (77k Expansion trigger ftw) and one other expansion fell to a late merit drop, but overall the Simguru has shown a lot of muscle, and is pretty certain to rise at least a spot or two in the rankings in the short to medium term. Sothis (109k expansion merits) and Ewah (97k merits) were the two most pushed expansions this Cycle.",
                "Intro": "By the time I get to this section my brain is just about half functional, so best take it all with a grain of salt. Everything below is just my opinion (because everything above is objective fact, obviously). ",
                "Body": "It seems that the buff to undermining Powers in the same major faction hasn't worked - yet. It might be that it will take a while for conflicts to develop, for people to catch on to that new way of earning merits, and for the Emperor's death to have a real impact on the political landscape of the Empire. The Imperial High Command at this point remains firm in their commitment to the unity of the Empire, but who knows what the future will bring - I hope it's strife, and lots of fun, because that would make for much more fun and dynamic Powerplay.<br /><br />\n\
                    With the huge buff to Undermining it looks like Powerplay is now, for most players, more about opposing other Powers than supporting your own. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not, but it definitely has made this week a bit more exciting. Some smaller Powers - Torval, Archon, Winters - have suffered, while the bigger ones were less affected, but it's entirely possible we'll see the bigger Powers in some trouble later on. After all, just a few Undermined systems can push even Arissa, Aisling, Mahon or Hudson into Turmoil. As a result, we might see a lot more movement up and down the rankings than we did in the past.<br /><br />\n\
                    The buff to Combat and Social Expansion was great. A+, Frontier. Credit where credit's due, it has breathed new life into some Powers and addressed the imbalance between combat and non-combat Powers. Powerplay is a hugely complex and original mechanic with a precedent I know of, and it really feels like it's slowly but surely becoming something very interesting.<br /><br />\n\
                    With the Undermining buff and the proposed increase to Fortification triggers it's clear that that a bit of balancing is in order. I mean, it's fine if some Powers are stronger and some are weaker, and if some fall apart, but if attackers in Powerplay are to have such a massive advantage, some disadvantaged Powers need to get a helping hand. Most of all, the Federation has suffered badly through having only 2 Powers since launch, and needs to get another one or two if an increase to Fortification triggers is to happen. Smaller Powers that might get knocked out at any time, like Archon, should start offering meaningful, desirable perks on par with Arissa's, Hudson's or Mahon's. If those smaller Powers are to struggle against all odds, they should at least get some reward for it.",

        "10": [{
                "Overview": "This has been a cycle of decreased support activity amongst most Powers. Hudson and Arissa are the notable exceptions, as they benefit, for the first time, from the increased combat expansion rewards. Torval saw largely similar support, while Patreus had a minor increase. All other Powers saw a fall in support actions, and that drop was fairly significant, around the 20% - 30% range for most. It has to be noted that drops like that have happened before and were often followed by rebounds, so it's hard to draw many conclusions from this week.<br /><br />Opposition activity, on the other hand, has increased quite significantly yet again. There are now four Powers with around 1 million in opposition activity in them, and half the Powers in the game see significantly more opposition than support. Only Arissa enjoys appreciably more support than opposition. Powerplay now sees significantly more opposition (6,765,225) than support (5,673,163) across all Powers.<br ><br />",
                "Hudson": "has, for the first time I believe, secured all of his expansions with relative ease, despite the fact that, as always, he sees pretty significant Opposition. In that way, the President enjoys the benefits of the combat expansion merit increase. However, Hudson continues to see heavy Undermining across its vast territory, and with Fortification dropping for the third week in a row, he barely avoided Turmoil, with just 22 CC surplus. As things are, turmoil seems unavoidable in the future, as it is perhaps for all large Powers, and what remains to be seen is what the President's supporters do with the boost they have been given. If they spread out their effort, doing more fortification and using the expansion boost to get 'good' new systems then shedding 'bad' ones in Turmoil, Hudson might very well be back in top 3 before too long - especially since players might be more willing to support combat Powers after the recent changes. Otherwise he'll probably remain around #5.",
                "Winters": "managed to recover from Turmoil with a respectable 262 CC to spend this Cycle. This is largely due to an impressive surge in fortification activity, which lead to successful fortification of six systems, while only 2 were Undermined. With that horrible support-to-opposition ratio, Winters proves again to be very resilient, and although IMO she's destined to spend most of her time in the bottom 5 (around 5 - 6), the threat posed by the doubling of undermining merits doesn't appear to be as existential as one might have supposed. So far pretty much all the mechanics changes in the game have hurt this Power. At the very least they appear resilient enough to await some positive changes, such as tweaks to Power ethos actions.",
                "Arissa": "has both met and defied my expectations. I think most of us watching Powerplay expected her to benefit hugely from the recent combat expansion merit increase, and to have the highest support figures of any Power. Personally I did not expect her to surge quite this much. She now enjoys more support activity than Aisling, Mahon, Patreus, Winters and Antal put together. She almost outdoes the Federation and the Alliance put together. She sees significantly more support than the rest of the Empire put together. Not to overemphasise the point, but the situation is quite amusing. With her Expansion activity increasing almost 20x there is no chance of any of her expansions failing in the foreseeable future. On one hand that's a good thing - if a system makes it on her Preparation list, it will be claimed by Arissa. On the other hand, it's not so great, precisely for the same reasons. There have been initiatives from Lavigny-Duval's camp to coordinate with other Powers in an effort to stop poor expansions by employing 'friendly' opposition, and to limit the rate of expansion altogether. As it is such arrangements are almost entirely certain to fail.",
                "Aisling": "is once again in Turmoil, with a nasty -359 CC deficit. This is in large part due to her monstrous Overhead compared to her income. In fact, the Princess fell into Turmoil without having a single one of her systems successfully Undermined. That's now to say her rivals didn't have a hand in her troubles. Around 30 of her systems had their fortification cancelled, costing this Power a significant amount of CC. While she still doesn't see as much Opposition as some other Powers, especially compared to her overall activity, what opposition there is has proven quite smart, spreading out their efforts. Duval still has a great strategic position, well-organised player groups and a lot of support, so she is certain to recover and climb the rankings again - as long as her supporters can make Turmoil work for them, and shed some of the less-than-ideal systems they've picked up during the recent weeks.",
                "Torval": " saw, for the first time since the withdrawal of the EIC five weeks ago, a modest increase in activity, stopping the downward slide of the last month. However, that is pretty much were good news ends for Senator Torval. With fairly large territory (48 control systems and 598 exploited ones) but the lowest support numbers in the game she is particularly vulnerable to enemy action, and indeed ten of her systems were successfully Undermined. What's worse both of Zemina's Expansions have fallen to heavy opposition. This makes Torval the Power at most risk of being wiped out, despite the fact that she received only a third of the opposition that Archon did. As we know, a Power in the bottom 3 which fails to Expand might collapse. Torval already failed once and is now in a 639 CC deficit, meaning she will not have an expansion next week. Given her low support-to-opposition ratio and the less-than-ideal triggers on her only expansion this week, she might very well see no expansions over a three week period. We don't know exactly what rules trigger a Power's collapse, but that seems like just the thing. In a way it's remarkable that this crisis didn't come sooner, delayed as it was by the actions of a fairly small group of die-hard supporters.",
                "Patreus": "has had half a dozen of his systems successfully undermined this week and escaped Turmoil by the skin of his teeth - 8 CC. While he has enjoyed a considerable surge in the last couple of weeks, this Senator is in a bit of a tricky position. The combat expansion boost allowed him to expand and a much greater pace than before and put a stop to a situation where Patreus had trouble even securing one or two new systems a week. As a result, he climbed the rankings. However, at the same time Fortification activity has not increased, meaning Patreus has a fairly large territory but not enough resources to secure it. Should his fortification falter this week or undermining increase he may find himself in Turmoil, dropping to bottom 3, and at risk due to not being able to do Preparation, and then Expansion. Patreus' supporters have proven before that they have the resources and organisation to pull their Power out of trouble when things seem grim and it will be interesting to see how well they did this time.",
                "Mahon": "is just downright impressive. Well, he's not, he's a fat, middle-aged bloke, but his support base certainly is. Thanks to well-spread out fortification and a legacy of good expansion choices, Mahon now enjoys a very respectable CC surplus despite being the subject of very heavy enemy activity and having seven of his systems successfully undermined. I was always somewhat skeptical when I saw Edmund's rise in the rankings, figuring it was mostly due to the Power not really seeing much in way of opposition. Even recently I was sure that while he would keep a spot in the top #3, he would lose #2 to Aisling sooner or later. While this might still happen it no longer seems ridiculous to think that the Alliance Power might outrank Aisling long-term, despite having 50% less support.",
                "Sirius": "has risen to #3 despite at the same time seeing an uptick in Undermining and a decrease in support, which combined dropped his support-to-opposition ratio to just 29%. I'm wrong about this Power so often that I hesitate to even say anything at this point, but there's a reason why predictions are hard in this case (not like they're easy rest of the time) In theory there's no way that Li Yong-Rui should be in the top 3 or even 4 long-term. One week's fluke? Sure, that may happen, even Torval was #2 before. But not long-term, not when they're only #8 in support. However, there are factors playing to Sirius' advantage. Good position, high-income systems and consistently solid fortification efforts (only 3 systems Undermined despite 750k undermining merits) are part of it, but more than anything, it's the misfortune of other Powers that elevates Li Yong-Rui. Long-term one would certainly expect Hudson and Aisling to rise above Sirius again, especially since that 200 CC-ish buffer can be wiped out with just 2 - 3 Undermined systems. Of course Li Yong-Rui's rise to prominence and his decent bonuses might actually gain him more support in the weeks to come, securing his position.",
                "Archon": "has had all fortification cancelled, 15 systems Undermined... and he's still alive and kicking. Archon's supporters have effectively proven that within the framework of the current mechanics a Power with very modest support cannot be pushed into Turmoil as long as their territory is fairly small and they continue determined fortification efforts, with the Kumo Crew seeing a nice increase in their fortification activity this week. Long-term Archon Delaine can certainly be ground down by undermining - as his territory increases and activity does not follow suit, eventually a point will be reached where defence is no longer sustainable. The question is how long such a thing would take, with Operation Davy Jones now in its sixth week. A comparison with any number of modern military conflicts of attrition could be made. However CC shortage and a slightly questionable Preparation choice do put Archon Delaine in a potentially perilous position this week. The systems prepared in cycle #10 was Gliese 828.4, with an expansion trigger of 5775 and opposition trigger of 12707. While it's a good trigger it's not a great one, and it's something that could feasibly be overcome. A massive battle is brewing... or would be brewing, if the system wasn't bugged, which last I heard it was. It will be interesting what Frontier does about this. Will they give the Kumo Crew no penalty for failing to expand, because they are victim to a bug? Or will they penalise them normally, seeing how it's the second time Archon tried to expand to Gliese 828.4? Personally I hope they will just fix the issue, we would have a grand conflict if that was the case.",
                "Antal": "continues to enjoy growth unprecedented for the previously bottom-of-the-rankings Power, securing 5 new systems and the #8 slot, with the real possibility of the Utopian leader leaving the bottom #3 soon. Even the daring attempt to claim the colony of Takurua, well beyond the bubble of inhabited space, has succeeded, a follow-up to the unsuccessful Project Sothis of the previous cycle. However, all is not gravy. In many ways Utopia is in a position similar to Denton Patreus - a growing Power with high expansion values but fortification perhaps too low for its size. In fact Utopian fortification is rather dire: it was the lowest in the game in cycle #9 and has dropped by 2/3rds in cycle #10. For the moment Pranav Antal enjoys the lowest levels of opposition in the game, due to lack of declared enemies, some diplomatic efforts and a fairly safe strategic position. Should this change the Power's rise could quickly be reversed. Another obstacle to continued growth is the aforementioned position. In the first few weeks, Antal had extremely low expansion values, due to having very few Commanders and combat expansion being tedious to say the least. Now that his expansion is more impressive much of the neighbouring region has already been claimed. Overall Antal deserves his #8 spot for the moment but has some major issues to overcome.",
                "Intro": "This is the section where I no longer have to pretend to be objective and I can spout whatever half-baked nonsense pops into my head. Whereas everything above is God's own given truth and objective fact (obviously), everything below is an opinion, or a rant, or a feverish dream I had once after getting drunk on Costco vodka.",
                "Body": "The buff to undermining merits is now in its second week and it seems to have made things a bit more interesting. Powers go up and down, everyone gets some undermining, stuff is generally more dynamic. It's good. I like it. However it still would be nice to have a boost to some Powers. I feel bad every time I remember that, say, Winters' supporters fight those overwhelming odds so they can enjoy a 5% boost to influence. Things are tougher now, and more challenging, and more interesting, and that's great, but people should be rewarded for sustaining their Powers.<br /><br />That combat merit buff though. If not for Overhead, Arissa would sweep through the galaxy as some sort of conquering horde, shouting about 'honour' and 'justice' while pew-pewing anything that doesn't 'bask'. Hudson's numbers finally come into play as well. The President has lots of pilots on his side, but it seems they're mostly more casual players or newbies, so a profitable way for them to earn merits was sure to help him out a lot, whereas before those numbers didn't really mean much. The change also means that some smaller Powers that were screwed by the old system now have a fighting chance, and that's cool. What's not so cool is that expansion just... doesn't feel very important. With Overhead always hanging over our heads (oh, how I crack myself up) there's always a feeling that any expansion is at best a mildly positive thing, and at worst effective sabotage. Most people seem to feel this way, and as a result you no longer get the great expansion battles of olden times - instead it's all about undermining. Not that expansion battles could even feasibly happen against Arissa or even Hudson. In fact, Arissa has put more merits into one expansion (Gende, 409,040) than Mahon has into all of his activity.<br /><br />                        <br /><br />It now looks like the Imperial offensive MAY, and I repeat MAY, succeed, depending on what happens in Gliese 828.4. We'll see. That's almost beside the point, though. The real thing we've learned from Operation Davy Jones, and I'm sure FD is taking notes, is that it's hard as hell to make a Power lose systems. I mean, I hate Imperials as much as any other guy, but I reckon that if you undermine or cancel every single system in an enemy Power's territory then maybe they should lose a system or two. In fact I'd like it Powers remained very hard to knock out of the game but systems changed hands more often, perhaps allowing for some direct invasion of another Power's system to add it to your own domain. Interesting things DO happen in Powerplay, they genuinely do, but they are mostly seen in the numbers, not changes on the map.<br /><br />Regarding what I said about the 'conquering horde' - it would be great if fleets from one Power could attack and 'rob' CC from another. Maybe if you steal cargo from those supply ships it actually helps your own Power, rather than becoming nothing but some merits. Perhaps that way 'roaming' Powers more interested in PvP and piracy would be viable. Does this even make sense? What IS CC? Is it some unit of resources? Is it just a measure of a Power's ability to project their, well, power? Tune in next week to not see answers to any of these questions.",
                "Conclusion": "Myself and some other Commanders have another project in the works that I personally think is waaaay more interesting than these weekly posts.

                "Overview": "After the drop in Powerplay activity last week, this week has seen more support for most of the Powers, even ignoring the huge surge for Arissa Lavigny-Duval. Amongst the exceptions Archon is most notable, with the lack of opportunity to expand because of a bug more than halving his activity values. Overall the trend is mostly stable, albeit a bit hard to judge precisely because of the change to undermining and expansion merit rewards.<br /><br />Just as during the previous Cycle, we saw an increase in opposition activity. Around half of the Powers in Powerplay receive more opposition than support, but that doesn't tell the whole story. While only Arissa and Aisling enjoy a strong support-to-opposition ratio, four Powers, most notably Archon, receive substantially more opposition than support. If not for the massive increase in expansion merit rewards a couple of weeks ago, it's fair to assume that only 2 out of the 10 Powers would have more support than opposition.",
                "Hudson": "always had the dubious pleasure of enjoying the worst strategic position in Powerplay, alongside Winters. While the President saw a nice increase in Expansion values post combat expansion buff, that is of little consequence. While other Powers see similar levels of Undermining, they are more spread out in Hudson's territory, undermining an unprecedented 16 of his systems. While a poor position is something Hudson and his followers can do nothing about it, the issues are worsened by high inefficiency in regards to fortification, leaving much of this Power's space vulnerable to undermining.",
                "Winters": "has, after a week's respite, gone into Turmoil again. This now seems to be an almost unavoidable state for the Shadow President, suffering from a very poor support-to-opposition ratio and some of the same issues as Hudson, but her supporters partially make up for those deficiencies with quite efficient fortification. With fewer fortification merits committed than Mahon or Hudson, Winters nevertheless fortified more systems, as a result seeing a lot fewer systems undermined than either of those Powers. As ever Winters received extremely high opposition and a support-to-opposition ratio of just 21%, although the Shadow President's situation is not half as bad as the numbers might suggest at first glance.",
                "Arissa": "has ruined my graphs. While she is #1 in Preparation and #2 in Fortification, it's Arissa's absolutely insane Expansion values that skew the data so badly that I need to start looking at ways to present it differently. Not only was she the first Power to break the 2 million merit barrier, she might have reached 3 million, given how close she was 2h before the end of the Cycle. As it is, Arissa sees more activity than all the Federation, Independent and Alliance Powers put together. In asking Frontier to buff combat expansion we have created a monster. God help us all. On a more serious note, this change puts more pressure on Lavigny's planners to push good systems on the Preparation list, as no matter what plans are hatched - such as diplomatic overtures asking other Powers to oppose her expansion - it's absolutely impossible at this time for any of her expansions to fail. With 69 control systems under her domain, the CC margins are getting slimmer, leaving her only 54 CC after just 4 successful underminings, making limited turmoil a certainty in the near future.",
                "Aisling": "has escaped the jaws of Turmoil. This is not entirely unexpected, given two factors. One was the announcement of a bug which affected the Power being fixed mid-week. The second was was a significant drop in opposition against Aisling, one of around 30%. Whether the much needed breathing room is just a fluke, or if we're returning to the good old tradition of Aisling hardly having to deal with any hostilities remains to be seen. Aisling's support base continues to be quite impressive, pushing over 600k merits despite not being able to do Preparation or Expansion, suggesting that despite some predictions to the contrary, her player-base has not appreciably diminished. It seems the Peoples' Princess is more than just 'the shield faction' supported for her unique module. While Aisling ended the cycle with a 300 CC surplus, that surplus was achieved with none of her systems successfully undermined, suggesting she remains unusually vulnerable to enemy action, should she start receiving serious opposition once more.",
                "Torval": "enjoyed an increase in support for the second week in a row, in a minor reversal of the extremely difficult situation this Power has found itself in. With a surprising surge out of Turmoil and a 233 CC surplus, Torval's supporters have some reasons to celebrate, as increased fortification meant that fewer of her systems (6 rather than 10) were successfully undermined this week. However, Torval is not out of the woods yet. Having failed expansion for three weeks in a row she is yet to be subjected to the collapse mechanic FD has laid out for bottom 3 Powers who fail to expand, and we don't know exactly how that collapse will play out, but it would be extremely surprising if the process did not at least begin this week. Lacking Preparation this week, Torval now has no Expansion, ensuring she will have been without an expansion for a straight month. If pushed into Turmoil through undermining once again this week, she might be almost certain to disappear - depending on the specifics of the collapse mechanics.",
                "Patreus": "was hit by Turmoil, as expected given his 8 CC surplus last Cycle. This is not necessarily disastrous for this Power. Patreus enjoys decent levels of support and as demonstrated this week, his supports can shift focus from expansion to fortification when the situation requires it, a move that saved Patreus from a much more serious Turmoil this week. With 8 systems in turmoil this Power has suffered a deficit of 'only' 127 CC, meaning it's not as vulnerable to enemy action as some others, but being at risk of falling into the bottom 3 makes any turmoil that much more dangerous. To Patreus' advantage is his combat expansion ethos, which makes it unlikely a Power will fail an expansion as long as they have some modest support and choose systems with half-decent triggers.",
                "Mahon": "was hit unexpectedly hard this week, even though the opposition values against him remained largely static. Better target selection by his enemies or just inefficient (and slightly lower) fortification meant that a total of 13 of Mahon's systems were successfully undermined, pushing him into Turmoil. It's a testament to smart expansion choices in the recent weeks that such heavy undermining resulted in a deficit of 'just' 251 CC, given that Powers of a similar size have been hit harder by more limited enemy action. That's not to understate the potential difficulties ahead for the Alliance politician - with nearly 40 systems left unfortified at the end of the previous Cycle, he remains quite vulnerable to future undermining.",
                "Sirius": "has escaped turmoil with an 83 CC surplus after having six of his systems Undermined, losing a place in the galactic ranking in the process. It's still quite remarkable that Sirius is even #4, given that he's #8 in support. While the razor-thin CC margin makes Turmoil almost unavoidable for this Power, in some ways Sirius is better equipped to deal with those issues than other Powers, with continued access to relatively uncontested high-CC systems and a better strategic position than almost any Power in the game, although that advantage was partially compromised by the Power's spread-out growth. With a relatively secure position and an understanding with ALD supporters, Sirius might be well positioned to shed 'bad' systems should turmoil occur. Funnily enough, the big threat for Sirius might be Hudson's turmoil, as the President's combat pilots, robbed of their precious combat zones, look elsewhere to gain their merits.",
                "Archon": "has a 7% support-to-opposition ratio, over 1.3 million opposition credits against him and an expansion target that will likely fail due to heavy enemy action. Yet the Pirate Lord is actually in a fairly good position - or at least better than anyone could expect. Despite having 12 systems undermined, Archon still runs a CC surplus of 372, the largest in Powerplay right now. Additionally, the situation with Torval can only be a morale boost for the pirate crew. After failing to expand for 3 weeks, Torval still shows no signs of suffering from the collapse mechanic. The biggest issue Archon's supporters always faced was the prospect of a week like this one - where they get just one Preparation and spend it poorly, getting an Expansion target that their enemies can reasonably oppose. Such failure could then trigger a death spiral, leading to Archon's destruction. Now that we know that Power collapse is a much slower process than many expected, the Kumo Crew can perhaps rest easier than they have done in the last few weeks. The Pegasi Pirate War can still end in the Pirate Lord's fall, but it appears that achieving that end will be harder than most likely expected.",
                "Antal": "still works towards leaving the bottom 3, a task the Power is likely to succeed at in the coming weeks. A surge in expansion support post combat merit increase is one factor, and the uniquely low levels of opposition Antal sees certainly help. While slow expansion in the first few weeks of Powerplay ensured that Utopia missed out on many good systems, it also ensured that Antal has no real rivals and serious conflicts. Now, after the boost to undermining, having few enemies seems to be the best boon a Power might have, a boon that has fuelled the rise of a Power that once was firmly in #10 every single week.",

                "Body": "It's certainly the case that as time goes on Powerplay seems to become more and more about countering other Powers rather than helping your own. In a way that's fine, since it stimulates conflict that has made PP a bit more interesting, but at the same time it's a bit of a shame that the tasks that Powers really need, so mostly fortification, are somewhat under-represented and under-rewarded compared to undermining and opposition.<br /><br />We're now getting a better look at the effects of the combat expansion buff, and I am not entirely sure what to think about it all. Expansion is in a strange, strange place now. There is absolutely no point in even attempting to stop an expansion by Arissa or Hudson, and it's hard to do so even for smaller Powers like Patreus or Antal. This further fuels a situation where opposition is increasingly neglected, with people focusing on undermining instead. That makes good tactical sense. Half the time expansions aren't even good for Powers, and I doubt more than a tiny fraction of the playerbase even understands which expansions are good and which are not, and with Powers falling into Turmoil more or less constantly now, CC from fortification is a much bigger deal than expansion. This is something of a shame, as undermining doesn't make for as interesting stories or PvP as expansion does - undermining a bunch of, say, Aisling's systems by blowing up her transport ships will never be as interesting as the big expansion conflicts of the olden days.<br /><br />I was going to make a bunch of predictions in this part but really, it's getting to a point where I'm starting to wonder if there's any point. Some trends seem mostly clear - for example, Mahon will stay in top 3 for the time being, Pranav Antal will probably climb another place or maybe two, Arissa will stay #1, Torval is likely to collapse... But beyond that? Things are just too volatile. With FD continously tweaking Powerplay and most Powers being literally 2 - 3 undermined systems from falling into turmoil at most, predictions are a tricky business, even disregarding whatever mistakes I make all by myself.<br /><br />I'm thinking of having a separate graph next week, looking at Powerplay activity values sans expansion, as combat expansion (particularly for Arissa) skews things a lot, and makes any graphs less readable. Thoughts?<br /><br />I have contacted FD asking if I would be allowed to include the raw data they send me in my weekly posts, but I have received no reply just yet, and I would rather not delay this post any longer. I will post an addendum if I do receive the a-okay later on.",

                "Overview": "Powerplay activity is mostly stable this week as far as support goes, with Arissa, Aisling, Antal and Toval seeing higher values, and the other Powers experiencing drops in support of varying magnitude. This is despite 5 Powers not being able to do expansion, and 3 Powers not being able to do Preparation.<br /><br />Opposition activity has been increasing every week since the buff to undermining & opposition, and this cycle was no exception. We're now in a position where only 2 out of the 10 Powers receive more support than opposition, and 5 out of the 10 Powers receive between 4x and 5x more opposition than support. Between this change, continued over-fortification in all Powers and Power reaching their growth limits, the pattern of repeated turmoil we've seen in the recent weeks is sure to continue for the foreseeable future.",
                "Hudson": "has had a much better week than the last, despite seeing no particular decrease to the high levels of opposition against him. Whether it's because of a lack of expansion targets or as a reaction to turmoil, Hudson saw a massive increase in fortification, from 311k to 566k. This allowed the President's supporters to fortify 17 more systems this cycle and, crucially, reduced the number of his successfully undermined systems from 17 to 0, explaining the massive CC surplus he's now enjoying. This is an amazing comeback, but it remains to be seen if it can be sustained once the more lucrative task of expansion is once again available to Hudson's supporters.",
                "Winters": "saw a rise in rankings that was unexpected but not undeserved. Some of it is due to the misfortune of her rivals, but not all of it. Winters' fortification has been quite efficient, with her 232k fortification merits securing 31 systems - a noticeably better rate of return than what we see from most other Powers. In the end just one of the Shadow President's systems has been successfully undermined, leaving her with a 133 CC surplus, despite being subject to over 1.3 million opposition merits.",
                "Arissa": "has secured, with absolute ease, two more expansion, bringing her to a total of 71 systems at the beginning of the new cycle. Despite that growth, ALD avoided turmoil while keeping a respectable CC buffer of 417 CC. The reasons are three-fold. Strong fortification efforts (#3 in fortification activity, but with more systems fortified than Aisling or Hudson), good fortification triggers and relatively low received undermining (#3 lowest in the game). This is obviously a very well-supported and resilient Power, and even when turmoil inevitably comes, any drop in standings should be temporary. When it comes to Expansion, things are just as insane as they have been this past week, or slightly more so. While even with no expansion Arissa would still be #2 in activity, slightly behind Aisling, it's those crazy expansion values that propel her activity values so far ahead of the other Powers. She now sees almost 4x more support than the two Federation Powers combined. In fact, Arissa Lavigny-Duval accounts of 50.61% of overall Powerplay support activity.",
                "Aisling": "is back in #2, having secured a mighty CC surplus of 45 and enjoying the 2nd highest levels of support, now that Hudson had to do without expansions. This ability of Aisling's supporters to bounce back from turmoil is testament to the high levels of support she has always received a return to a period of relative peace, as opposition against her has fallen again. Until the Princess can shed some systems, however, she remains very vulnerable should opposition ramp up again. With fewer systems and just 1 Undermined systems (to ALD's 2) she is already almost in turmoil, while the other big Imperial Power enjoys a decent surplus of CC. This is partly due to less efficient fortification, but some of it must be a legacy of past, less-than-ideal expansions, and Aisling's long-term situation won't become noticeably more secure until some of those systems are shed.",
                "Torval": "has fallen deep into turmoil once again. Despite stretching her 137k fortification merits quite far, securing 16 systems, she has had 19 others successfully undermined and has failed to secure a new expansion. Failing a surge in support it now seems unlikely that Torval will be able to recover without shedding a good number of systems, but we still don't know if she will have the time to do so. Powerplay rules state that collapse of a Power can be triggered when they're in the bottom 3 and they fail to expand. The more that happens, the higher the risk of collapse. This has been the 3rd week that Torval failed to expand while in the bottom 3 and, to some surprise, that is yet to have any negative effect on the Power. Being in turmoil this week, however, ensured Torval will have no expansions next cycle - a dire state of affairs if she doesn't manage to secure her sole expansion this week. Will that finally trigger a collapse? We just don't know, but other Powers at risk, particularly Archon, no doubt are watching what's happening to Torval with a lot of interest, since she already proved that Powers are harder to wipe out than some have predicted.",
                "Patreus": "fell down the rankings this week, dropping to #8, but contrary to most expectations he has not hit turmoil - that's despite the fact that he did see a fall in fortification activity this week, being dead last in overall support. Patreus' supporters were simply more efficient this week, using fewer fortification merits to fortify 23 systems, rather than last week's 16. As a result, 6 of the Senator's control systems were successfully undermined, a small decrease from last week. If this sort of smart fortification can be kept up in the future weeks, Patreus should be able to rise in the rankings once again, but with undermining against him rising every week, he remains vulnerable - in absence of increased support, efficiency only stretches so far.",
                "Mahon": " is deep in the red this week, after a week of unprecedented opposition and lower fortification. I'm told that the fall into turmoil was planned by at least some of the Power's supporters as a means to trim the fat and get rid of some of the less desirable systems. That would certainly account for the 25% drop in fortification, with the increased (and more efficient) undermining doing the rest of the job. At the same time, the drop into turmoil is likely higher than most have expected, and Mahon's supporters now face an unprecedented challenge of making deep turmoil work for them. If they succeed the Power will be back in top #3 before long, but it's hard to tell how things will go when stepping into uncharted territory like this.",
                "Sirius": "has dropped to #9 in support and support-to-opposition ratio, while seeing a modest increase to opposition against him. Two major reasons behind those issues can be pointed out. One, Li Yong-Rui saw only slightly lower fortification values this week, but they were less efficient, with 15 systems fortified, compared to last week's 20. Two, while overall the opposition against this Power is largely stable, with no expansions to oppose it was all focused on undermining - 846k compared to last week's 725k. Sirius has long punched above their weight, rising higher than their support data would suggest, but it appears to be increasingly difficult to deal with the high opposition, given their large territory.",
                "Archon": "has had a better week than his #10 position would suggest. While the Power failed to secure an expansion, a less-than-ideal thing while in the bottom 3, that seems to have triggered no ill effect. At the same time Archon's supporters prepared 3 new systems for expansion. While one is the famous, bugged Gliese 828.4, the other two have decent triggers and good CC incomes. Given how close the expansion over Archon's one sole target was last week, it's likely that the Kumo Crew will be able to secure one new system this week, making them safe against collapse. Interestingly, for the first time since the start of the Pegasi Pirate War, the undermining values against Archon have fallen, although the decrease is not particularly significant. It remains a funny fact of Powerplay that Achon, the Power under the most pressure of any in the game, is actually enjoying a CC surplus that most of his rivals would rightfully envy. With collapse mechanics unclear and the proposed increase to fortification triggers not forthcoming for the time being, it's unclear if it's even possible to wipe out Archon Delaine in anything but the very long term.",
                "Antal": "is up a place again, leaving the bottom 3 - an achievement that most Antal supporters have, until quite recently, considered impossible, being content to simply avoid being wiped out. While this Power's growth has slowed somewhat, with just 2 new systems being added this week, Antal benefits from receiving the lowest undermining of any Power. While the combat expansion boost benefited Utopia a great deal, fairly low fortification values and a growing territory make it increasingly vulnerable, and unless it sees a boost in support, a rise further up might be difficult to sustain.",
                "Intro": "This is my section for rants, requests, questions and general babble that is too incoherent or dumb to go in the half-respectable 'Analysis' section.",
                "Body": "The massive increase in expansion values for combat Powers, especially ALD, says two things, IMO. One, always keep in mind that most E:D players are combat players and bounty hunters first and foremost. It's no accident that the Power with combat expansion and the best perks for bounty hunting is seeing so much support. Two, people are still willing to engage with Powerplay and spend a lot of effort on it, whatever their motivations. The moment that a non-hauling way to earn merits and rewards was opened, people flocked to it. If the same can be done for fortification and preparation (through more varied tasks, or integrating the mission systems into Powerplay) we might see a resurgence of interest in that part of the game.<br /><br />I was going to put a bunch of new graphs and stuff in this week's post, but I didn't get the data until late, and I'm lazy, so maybe next week.

                "Overview": "We've seen a modest drop in Powerplay activity this week, with no significant increases for any Power, and a fairly major drop for Aisling Duval. When it comes to Opposition, the recent trend of steadily increasing values is broken, although the Independents saw another rise. This was a particularly good week for Imperial Powers, with all four in the bottom 5 most opposed.",
                "Hudson": "maintains a good CC surplus thanks to wide-spread fortification, despite having 7 systems successfully undermined. Just as importantly, Hudson had a round of unusually smart preparations, targeting systems between 93 CC and 126 CC for expansion in cycle #14. Add to that slightly lower undermining in the recent weeks, and Hudson might be doing well for himself in the near future, with his combat expansion ethos making most, if not all, of his expansions an almost guaranteed success.",
                "Winters": "dropped in the rankings, but arguably still did better than expected, weathering a storm of almost 1.3 million undermining merits. Despite 3 of her systems being successfully undermined, she still finished the cycle with a small (79 CC) surplus. This is a testament to another week of efficient fortification, fortifying more systems than Aisling or Arissa, with not much more than half the fortification activity.",
                "Arissa": "still enjoys those absolutely insane expansion values. Any opposition her expansions receive is functionally irrelevant. At the same time, she saw a 50% drop in undermining, which meant that despite a drop in fortification she still finished the week without a single successfully undermined system - the only Power this this distinction. It's worth noting that even with the expansion values completely exluded, Arissa would still be in the #1 spot for support activity. With 72 systems in cycle #14, she is obviously reaching the limits of feasible expansion, though her 221 CC surplus should allow her to get another couple of systems, as long as she continues to have a relatively easy time undermining-wise. Arissa now accounts for 52.9% of overall Powerplay support activity, slightly up from last week.",
                "Aisling": "is still in #2, though her CC surplus has fallen to 27. This is a large, well-supported, but fairly fragile Power, almost falling into Turmoil despite only having 3 systems Undermined. Some of this can be blamed on poor expansion choices, but her ethos is at least partly to blame - she enjoys the strange honour of being an Imperial Power with no control bonuses against the most common Imperial government systems (Patronage, Feudal and to lesser extent Dictatorship) and indeed a penalty against Feudal. Failing any changes that allow Powers to feasibly shed unwanted systems, she might be doomed to drop in and out of top #3, depending on how much undermining she receives in a given week.",
                "Torval": "is out of Turmoil, having lost 6 systems, dropping her to a more manageable 40, and leaving her with a 160 CC surplus that should be sufficient for an expansion or two next week. More worryingly, however, Torval has failed to secure an expansion while in the bottom 3 for a 4th week in a row, and lacks an expansion target this week, making it certain she will be on a 5 week streak before she has a change to fight for an expansion again. Somewhat confusingly, though, those failed expansions appear to have had no effect on Torval so far. Not only did the Power not collapse, there is nothing in the mechanics or GalNet that would suggest that the process has started, or is about to start, or that collapse is even a threat in the short to medium term. Lacking word from FD or some lore tidbits on GalNet, it's not entirely clear if collapse is even possible at this moment. It remains to be seen if this respite can be used by Torva's supporters, who now have a chance to muster their forces to fortify their now-smaller holdings.",
                "Patreus": "has recovered after a ranking drop, even maintaining an impressive 413 CC surplus. This is likely largely due to a fall in undermining, which more than offset a drop in Patreus' own fortification efforts, but the surplus is still fairly significant, given that four of Patreus' systems were successfully undermined. While Patreus dropped to #10 in support, we're likely to see that change in cycle #14, as the combat-ethos Power now has 2 expansions to push. Those expansions should help Patreus secure his ranking, as long as no significant increase to undermining occurs.",
                "Mahon": "has seen a strong recovery in activity this week, showing they are perhaps the most organised Power in PP. It's worth comparing this power to Aisling - both have as many systems, and both had 3 systems undermined last week, but Mahon finished the cycle with a 1,183 CC surplus, rather more impressive than Aisling's 27 CC. Using 357k fortification merits to fortify 46 systems, Mahon is right up there with Winters in fortification efficiency, and his supporters have shown they're capable of using an then shrugging off Turmoil to their benefit.",
                "Sirius": "has not had as much publicity as Archon did in the course of the Pegasi Pirate War, but his situation is arguably more difficult. With a worse expansion ethos, more systems to fortify and almost as much Underming as the pirate lord, Sirius has slid down the rankings, reversing the trend of the small Power punching well above its weight in Powerplay. Even after losing a massive 7 systems in cycle #13, Sirius is still in turmoil, having had the second most successfully undermined systems, just after Torval. Fairly poor fortification triggers certainly contribute to Li Yong-Rui's troubles, but in any case it seems unlikely this Power will recover without shedding more systems, unless undermining suddenly drops again.",
                "Archon": "is apparently getting used to life in the trenches, still suffering massive undermining, but continuing regardless. In fact the pirate Power has secured an expansion, further dispelling the possibility of collapse that already seemed unlikely given the Torval situation. With undermining by Imperial forces simply, mechanically unable to force the Power into turmoil given Archon's relatively strong fortification efforts, the case is that in the short to medium term, the Kumo Crew is under no threat whatsoever, and all the Pegasi Pirate War might accomplish is continued isolation and containment of Archon Delaine. With the Torval situation being as it is, it's not even clear if Archon is under any threat even in the long term, and given that Frontier has not followed up on their suggestion of a second fortification trigger increase, Archon will probably continue doing just fine for now.",
                "Antal": "is back in the bottom 3, falling to #9 after significantly increased undermining and one failed expansion. While this drop might be disappointing to Utopians, it was clear that a continued rise with weak fortification values was not sustainable. instead, cycle #13 saw Antal with less expansion but more fortification focus, with Antal reaching their highest fortification values yet. This switch to a strategy of more fortification but slower expansion is likely the best thing for Utopia's long-term health. Of interest is the Utopian strategy of using the distant expansion into Takurua, with its -106 CC income, as a buffer to expansion.",
                "Intro": "This is my section for rants, requests, questions and general babble that is too incoherent or dumb to go in the half-respectable 'Analysis' section. I'll rant a bit more here this week, seeing how it's my closing week.",
                "Body": "Archon should be in the risk of collapsing, or at least he should be losing some systems. I know this is a sentiment that won't make me very popular amongst Archon's supporters, many of whom I really deeply respect, but that's how it is. A Power with 84k in fortification should not be able to shrug off over 1.1 million in undermining (even if much of that undermining is stupidly wasted). Kudos to the Kumo Crew for playing smart with the current mechanics, they have focused their efforts where they're needed and they've seen results as an effect, but the mechanics themselves are at fault. Of course in an ideal world of balanced mechanics the Kumo Crew would have useful bonuses and a useful weapon, Arissa wouldn't be receiving over 50% of Powerplay support, Aisling and Arissa would actually see some undermining and opposition, and generally Powers would be a bit more balanced in support and population. So when I say that this ratio of undermining of fortification should mess up Archon big time, that's just part of a bigger picture, and any change to undermining mechanics must come with much-needed balancing to other parts of the game.<br /><br />\n\
                        What is going on with Torval? I get that perhaps, according to FD's plan, 4 weeks without an expansion is not enough to collapse a Power, but surely this sort of pressure should at least be mentioned in GalNet, some tears at the seams should show, there should be some indication that keeping the Power down actually has an effect. Ideally we would have both that and an explanation from FD, telling us exactly how the collapse mechanic works.<br /><br />\n\
                        Last week someone told me I didn't give enough credit to certain player groups and to efforts to lower fortification triggers for ALD. Indeed, those efforts are impressive, and Arissa is benefiting from them - we see the same in Hudson and Winters, for example, though I am not sure how those campaigns compare, and how successful they are. It's worth noting, though, that Arissa excellent trigger values for fortification are at least in part due to her favourable ethos. She enjoys bonuses to control against Patronage and Feudal, the two most common Imperial systems of government. On the flip side, the two Federation Powers don't get a bonus for Democratic systems, despite Democracy being the most common form of minor faction government in Federation space. Winters at least gets a bonus against Corporate, which is quite common, but poor Hudson holds the Federation heartland while getting bonuses against Patronage and Feudal. That's kinda funny, or sad, depending on how you look at things.<br /><br />\n\
                        One reason why I'm no longer so much into these posts is that making predictions is almost impossible when most of the Powers are literally a couple of Undermined systems away from Turmoil. At the same time major changes just don't happen, and the dynamic back-and-forth and major battles that we saw in the first few weeks just aren't there any more. Why bother opposing Winters' new expansion, when most of the userbase probably doesn't even know when an expansion is beneficial and when it's not, and most expansions are actually harmful? Why bother trying to oppose ALD, when success is literally impossible? Combine that with the situation in Torval and Archon, and you get a pretty stagnant system.<br /><br />\n\
                        Probably the trigger for me being done with Powerplay analysis was when I introduced some friends to Powerplay and explained the mechanics to them. I went over the Power with them and told them what the bonuses were - and in no time at all, the game had two more ALD supporters. At first I wanted to convince them to join Pranav Antal, my Power, but then I figured I just couldn't do so in good conscience. They're still relatively new to the game, they have fun blowing stuff up, and they have that mercenary mindset that most Elite players have. Why should I convince them to join a Power that will offer them quite literally nothing at all of use, a pointless rank 2 bonus and a worthless unique weapon? Then it struck me - it has been 3 months and not only has there been absolutely 0 balancing between Powers, there is every indication that such balancing will not be coming in the foreseeable future. When I think about, say, Archon or Winters supporters putting in so much good, smart, organised work into the game and getting pretty much nothing for it, while an ALD supporter gets an amazing rank 2 bonus for 15 minutes of work, I genuinely get a bit angry, and I get angrier still when I remember that this is apparently working as intended.<br /><br />\n\
                        That being said, I'm not out of Powerplay. I still love Utopia, and I want to help it survive, and I will never cease to derive great pleasure from pewpewing Patreus' ships. I still think the core of Powerplay is interesting and it's fun, it stimulates social interaction like nothing else in the game, and it was a fine addition to E:D. It's just that Powerplay is enjoyable from the ground level, or organising your own Power - it's increasingly clear to me that some overall analysis and trying to make sense of this fun but unbalanced and ever-shifting, buggy mess is pointless.",
                "Conclusion": "Fun fact! Hudson's supporters have sent preparation to 523 systems in cycle #13. The other Powers put together sent prep to just around 400. This isn't the first time Hudson's fine pilots decided their time would be best spent delivering 10 prep to half the systems in inhabited space, but I think this is the most extensive preparation network to date. I just thought it would be poor form to finish on a rant :D. Thanks for reading everyone, and thanks for your kindness over the last 3 months. See you out in the black.",
